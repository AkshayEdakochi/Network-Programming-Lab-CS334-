# Network-Programming-Lab-CS334-
This repository houses programs done as a part of my curriculum for the course Network Programming Lab (CS334) in year 2019-2020
The Experiments list

CYCLE 1

1. Getting started with Basics of Network configurations files and Networking Commands in
Linux. 
2. To familiarize and understand the use and functioning of System Calls used for Operating
system and network programming in Linux. 
3. Familiarization and implementation of programs related to Process and thread. 
4. Implement programs for Inter Process Communication using PIPE, Message Queue and
Shared Memory. 
5. Implement the First Readers-Writers Problem.
6. Implement the Second Readers-Writers problem.

CYCLE 2 

7. Implement Client-Server communication using Socket Programming and TCP as transport
layer protocol. 
8. Implement Client-Server communication using Socket Programming and UDP as transport
layer protocol.
9. Implement a multi user chat server using TCP as transport layer protocol.
10. Implement Concurrent Time Server application using UDP to execute the program at remote
server. Client sends a time request to the server, server sends its system time back to the
client. Client displays the result.
11. Implement and simulate algorithm for Distance vector routing protocol.
12. Implement and simulate algorithm for Link state routing protocol.
13. Implement Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
14. Develop concurrent file server which will provide the file requested by client if it exists. If
not server sends appropriate message to the client. Server should also send its process ID
(PID) to clients for display along with file or the message.

CYCLE 3

15. Using Wireshark observe data transferred in client server communication using UDP and
identify the UDP datagram.
16. Using Wireshark observe Three Way Handshaking Connection Establishment, Data Transfer
and Three Way Handshaking Connection Termination in client server communication using
TCP.
17. Develop a packet capturing and filtering application using raw sockets.
18. Design and configure a network with multiple subnets with wired and wireless LANs using
required network devices. Configure the following services in the network- TELNET, SSH,
FTP server, Web server, File server, DHCP server and DNS server.
19. Install network simulator NS-2 in any of the Linux operating system and simulate wired and
wireless scenarios.
